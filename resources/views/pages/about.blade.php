                I’m Lee Wisener, Glasgow-based mortgage veteran, data enthusiast, and repeat offender in the art of overthinking. I work for a bank, but this site is entirely a personal project and 
                not connected with my employer. It’s my tidy corner for clean, independent, data-led insight on UK property: sales from HM Land Registry, repossession activity from official court 
                statistics, and Bank of England interest rates & approvals, presented without spin.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">What you’ll find</h2>
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-800">
            On this site you’ll find clear and concise analysis of the UK housing market, built entirely around official data. You can explore sales trends through the Sales Explorer, track 
            repossession activity across counties and local authorities, and follow interest rate movements and mortgage approvals using Bank of England data. Every chart, table, and dashboard 
            is designed to be simple, honest, and data-led — no gimmicks or spin, just clean insight into how the property market moves.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Data sources</h2>
        <ul class="mt-3 list-outside list-disc pl-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-800">
            <li><span class="font-medium">HM Land Registry, England &amp; Wales</span> — price paid data for every residential sale back to the mid‑1990s, including price, property type, tenure and new build status.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Registers of Scotland</span> — Scottish residential sales, handled separately under different licensing.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">ONS Postcode Directory</span> — quarterly postcode lookup that links every UK postcode to local authority, LSOA or Data Zone, region and coordinates. Used to attach geography to sales, EPCs and deprivation.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Indices of Multiple Deprivation</span> — IMD for England, WIMD for Wales, SIMD for Scotland, NIMDM for Northern Ireland. Used for deprivation maps and top / bottom rankings.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">EPC certificates</span> — Domestic Energy Performance Certificates for England, Wales and Scotland. Used to understand efficiency, heating type and build age by area and property style.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Official court statistics</span> — possession claims, orders, warrants and repossessions at local authority and county court circuit level.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Bank of England</span> — Bank Rate history, mortgage approvals and secured lending volumes.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">ONS and central government releases</span> — household counts, population, housing supply and completions, affordability ratios and planning data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-600">Northern Ireland data appears in deprivation and map views, but postcode level search is limited by licensing, so I cannot publish a full postcode lookup for Northern Ireland.</p>

    {{-- Method --}}
    <section class="mb-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Method, in short</h2>
        <ul class="mt-3 list-outside list-disc pl-5 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-800">
            <li><span class="font-medium">Use codes, not guesses</span> — joins are done on official identifiers like local authority codes, LSOA codes, Data Zone codes and EPC property IDs, not just names like “Bristol”. Where names differ, I keep a small alias map and present the cleaned label on screen.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Keep it faithful</span> — I ingest the raw government CSVs and import them almost as‑is into MySQL. The site shows the real series, not a model or forecast.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Aggregate clearly</span> — monthly data can be rolled up to quarterly or yearly where that makes trends easier to read. Anything that is year‑to‑date is marked as year‑to‑date.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Warm and cache heavy work</span> — large queries, for example Land Registry history by postcode district or deprivation lookups, get pre‑computed and cached so pages load fast even on big datasets.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Reproducible</span> — built with Laravel 11, MySQL and Tailwind. Queries are plain and auditable and can be re‑run locally.</li>
        </ul>

    {{-- Caveats --}}
    <section class="mb-8 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Caveats &amp; common sense</h2>
        <ul class="mt-3 list-inside list-disc text-sm leading-6 text-gray-800">
            <li>Names aren’t keys. Where things must join, I use codes or a small alias map.</li>
            <li>Data lags exist. Official releases aren’t real‑time, and YTD isn’t a full year.</li>
            <li class="text-rose-700">This is analysis, not advice. Please don’t base a life decision on a single chart.</li>
